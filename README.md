# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT 
With globalization and ease of global mobility more students decided to pursue their education overseas, thus boosted the overseas education market, the majority of which are undergraduate students. This leads to raise in demand for overseas study consulting services. According to the non-profit organization NAFSA, Chinese students contributed US$13 billion to the US economy last year. Chinese students also made up 11 percent of all students in Australia in 2017 and many top universities have ‘extraordinary levels’ of exposure to the Chinese market, according to the Sydney-based Centre for Independent Studies.      

This project aims to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence to transform the oversea study consultancy service. It is built to provide a one-stop oversea course recommendation and study aboard associated services for students who want to discover their enriching oversea study experience.
